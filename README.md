To help the people who are in quarantine and analyse their needs we have come up with this solution of <strong>BeatCorona Android Application</strong>. This is one stop solution for all the needs of people in quarantine.<br><br><br><br><br>

## Idea

The idea is to ease the life of people who are in quarantine and cannot leave their houses. BeatCorona helps people to order items from nearby shop where they live. So as to prevent the people from going out from their houses to buy necessary items. Users have a option for pickup or delivery once they have added the items which they want to buy. In case of pickup the shopkeeper has to pack the required items for the customer so they can collect it anytime and for delivery the shopkeeper prepares all the orders for a particular society and deliever them at once with mandatory security measures of covid19. Besides this the application will have lot more useful features to promote hygiene and reminds people to follow guidelines issued by government.
